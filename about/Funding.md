# Acknowledgements and Funding

The development of solids4foam has not been supported by a single dedicated funding
 grant. However, significant parts of the methodology, algorithms, and software
 infrastructure implemented in solids4foam were developed in the context of publicly
 and industry-funded research projects.

We therefore gratefully acknowledge the support of the following funding bodies
 and programmes, whose projects contributed research outcomes, code, and validation
 cases that have fed into solids4foam over time:

- **Research Ireland** (formerly Science Foundation Ireland and the Irish Research
  Council) — through research centres, postgraduate, and investigator-led projects
  supporting computational mechanics and multiphysics modelling.
- **European Research Council (ERC)** — through the **XenoSim** (<https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101088740>)
  ERC-funded research project in computational solid mechanics and fluid–structure
  interaction.
- **Enterprise Ireland** — via industry–academic collaboration projects and
  research centres that contributed to applied modelling challenges and software
  development.
- **Croatian Science Foundation (HRZZ)** — through nationally funded research projects
  supporting the development and application of advanced numerical methods, computational
  fluid dynamics, computational solid mechanics, and high-performance scientific
  computing.

The views and implementations expressed in solids4foam are those of the developers
 and contributors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the funding agencies.
